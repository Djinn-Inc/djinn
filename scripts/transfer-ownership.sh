# Transfer ownership of all Djinn contracts to a multisig (e.g. Safe).
#
# Use this AFTER deployment to hand off control from the deployer key
# to a multisig wallet. Once transferred, only the multisig can:
#   - Change the protocol treasury address
#   - Authorize new contract callers
#   - Pause/unpause contracts
#   - Update protocol parameters
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/transfer-ownership.sh <new_owner_address>
#
# Example:
#   ./scripts/transfer-ownership.sh 0xYourSafeMultisigAddress
